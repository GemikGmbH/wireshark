    This reverts commit 0452f763fb0dd2cf7e38f0a127c306199a814c3e. Changes should
    have been made in ChannelProperties instead of Submodule state. Current
    implementation merely *appears* to be correct as we are reading it as a two bit
    value but instead should be addressing it as individual bits, little endian

    Lua: regex test suite fails with UTF-8 locale
    
    Due to the change in change-id Ib43e16a9d98d08e5ddaff81fd3235f5b64d7b95b, the setlocale() call has been moved earlier in tshark's processing, such that Lua plugins load with the environment locale instead of C-locale. Since that matches Wireshark's behavior, it's good, but it causes the Lua regex test suite to fail. So the test suite needs to be fixed.

    Lua: FieldInfo '==' check isn't really equality
    
    The FieldInfo metamethod for equality (letting you use the '==' operator)
    doesn't check for equality, but rather if the left-hand side is within
    the right-hand side. It should be equality instead. Also, all of the
    FieldInfo operate overloads should push a boolean even if they're false
    result.

Date:   Wed Dec 24 15:04:01 2014 -0500

    Bug 10233 - Wireshark crashes if Lua heuristic dissector returns true
    
    Because call_heur_dissector_direct() didn't set the pinfo->heur_list_name
    before calling the heuristic dissector, heur_dissect_lua() would invoke
    report_failure().  Unfortunately, calling report_failure() within a dissector
    can cause problems because GTK continues invoking timed callbacks while
    it displays the modal dialog created by report_failure()... without yet
    returning from report_failure().  In such a case, it's possible for
    epan_dissect_run() to be called while still within the execution of a
    previous call to epan_dissect_run(), which casues an assert since
    epan_dissect_run() is not reentrant.
    
    So this commit both fixes the call_heur_dissector_direct() bug as well
    as avoids using report_failure() within heur_dissect_lua().  It also
    upadtes the dissector.lua script used in the testsuite to match the one
    pubshied on the wiki, since that script's heuristic dissector triggered
    the bug.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Dec 26 18:46:10 2014 -0800

    Don't use a leading - in getopt_long() option strings.
    
    The behavior of a leading - is platform-dependent.  It also means that
    non-option arguments are treated in a fashion that we're not handling,
    so capture filters given as non-option arguments at the end of the
    command line don't work.  (The Linux getopt() man page says that a
    leading - "is used by programs that were written to expect options and
    other argv-elements in any order and that care about the ordering of the
    two."  We are not such a program.)

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Dec 26 14:37:31 2014 -0800

    Use getopt_long() for the first pass through the argument list.
    
    That way:
    
    	1) we don't have to worry about the system getopt() and our
    	   getopt_long(), on platforms that have getopt() but not
    	   getopt_long() (Solaris prior to Solaris 10, HP-UX, AIX), not
    	   working well together;
    
    	2) if necessary, we can handle long options in the first pass.
    
    Switch to using getopt_long() for the *second* pass for the GTK+ version
    of Wireshark.
    
    Use the documented mechanism for resetting the argument parser for the
    glibc version of getopt_long(); use the mostly-undocumented-but-at-least-
    they-documented-optreset mechanism for the *BSD version.
    
    (We should look into doing only one pass, saving away arguments that
    can't fully be processed in the first pass for further processing after
    initializing libwireshark.)

    Fix handling of 3-component OS version numbers.

    This fixes the handling of version numbers such as 10.10.1.
    
    (A 2-component version number doesn't match, but that's OK - the sed
    command doesn't use -n, so that just means it's unchanged by the
    command.)

    Don't assert out on tvb_memcpy() with a null data pointer if the length is 0.
    
    If the length is 0, there's nothing to copy, so it doesn't matter if
    there's no data to copy from.  This fixes problems caused by allocating
    a zero-length buffer and using that as the data for a tvbuff; the
    allocation returns null, so the data pointer is null.

    Presumably the intent is to dump *non*-dummy entries.
    
    I.e., presumably the intent is to dump *resolved* hosts, rather than
    *unresolved* hosts where there's no known host name and the name field
    is a string form of the address (the premise being that looking the
    address up in the hash table repeatedly, and using the already-generated
    string, will be faster than generating the string repeatedly).

    For the saved/restored geometry to be consistently correct we need to always
