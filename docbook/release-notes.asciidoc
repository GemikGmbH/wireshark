== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.

== Known Problems

Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes.
(ws-buglink:1419[])

The BER dissector might infinitely loop.
(ws-buglink:1516[])

Capture filters aren't applied when capturing from named pipes.
(ws-buglink:1814[])

Filtering tshark captures with read filters (-R) no longer works.
(ws-buglink:2234[])

Resolving (ws-buglink:9044[]) reopens (ws-buglink:3528[]) so that Wireshark
no longer automatically decodes gzip data when following a TCP stream.
